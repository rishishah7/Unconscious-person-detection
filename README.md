# Unconscious-person-detection
This project uses machine-learning to detect if the person in the image is unconscious or not.

My college organised Let's Hack - Covid 19 Edition Hackathon organised by PDPU Innovation and Incubation Center and my problem statement was "AI Detection Of Unconscious Person On Roadside."

myclassification.py is written in python and a deep learning model was made using libraries like Keras,Tensorflow and Scikit learn. This model uses neural network to detect uses image feed from surveillance to detect if the person in the frame in conscious or not which is of great importance.
